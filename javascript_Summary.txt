------------------------💡 JavaScript Summary-------------------
JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used to make web pages interactive.

--------------------🔧 Key Features:
Client-Side Language (runs in the browser)

Supports event-driven, functional, and object-oriented programming

Dynamically typed (no need to declare variable types)

Works well with HTML and CSS for front-end development

Can also be used on the server-side (Node.js)

---------------📚 Basic Syntax:
javascript
Copy
Edit
let name = "John";  // variable
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
}
greet();
-----------------------🧱 Core Concepts:
Variables (var, let, const)

Data Types: string, number, boolean, object, null, undefined, symbol, bigint

Operators: +, -, ===, &&, etc.

Control Flow: if, else, switch, for, while

Functions: regular, arrow functions (()=>)

Objects and Arrays

DOM Manipulation: Access & modify HTML dynamically

Events: Respond to user actions like clicks or keypresses

Asynchronous JS: setTimeout, Promises, async/await

-----------------🌐 Where JavaScript is Used:
Frontend web development (along with HTML/CSS)

Backend development (Node.js)

Mobile apps (React Native)

Desktop apps (Electron)

Game development

Web APIs and IoT



--------------🕰️ History of JavaScript---------------------------------
📌 1995 – Birth of JavaScript
Created by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications.

Originally named Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript (to ride on Java’s popularity, though they are very different).

⏱ It was created in just 10 days!

📌 1996 – Standardization Starts
JavaScript was submitted to ECMA International.

Resulted in the creation of the ECMAScript standard (official language name).

📌 1997 – ECMAScript 1
First standardized version of JavaScript as ECMAScript (ES1).

📌 1999 – ES3 Released
Introduced regular expressions, try/catch, and other core features.

Widely adopted and used for many years.

----------------📌 2009 – ES5
Big update: strict mode, JSON support, Array methods (forEach, map, filter).

Brought better browser compatibility and performance.

----------------📌 2015 – ES6 (ES2015): Major Evolution
Most important update in JS history.

Introduced:

let, const

Arrow functions (() => {})

Classes

Modules (import/export)

Promises

Template literals

Destructuring

Default + Rest parameters

📌 2016–Present – Yearly Updates
New version released every year (ES2016, ES2017, ...).

Features added:

async/await (ES2017)

Optional chaining ?.

Nullish coalescing ??

Array.flat()

Top-level await

#private class fields

Records & Tuples (in progress)

📌 JavaScript Today
Runs on browsers, servers (Node.js), mobile apps, IoT, and desktop apps.

Powering frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, and backend tools like Express.js.

JavaScript is one of the most widely used and versatile languages in the world.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

javascript is higher level programming language, which is interpreted. JS support both approches (POP, OOP).

scope: web development(ExpressReactNode), mobile development(React Native), desktop development(Electron.js)

client side js / server side js

interpreter(client web browser)

compiled (compiler (troub c++, dev cpp)) / interpreted (interpreter, )

line 1 
line 2 
line 3 
line 4 
line 5

dynamically typed language (JS, Python) / Static typed language(C , C++, JAVA, TypeScritp)

while creating data we will have define the data type

int age 
string name

let age = 10
let age = "ten" 

data type will be determined at the runtime
